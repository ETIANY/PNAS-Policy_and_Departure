Does Trump’s China Initiative Policy Disproportionately Target Scientists of Chinese Descent in US?

The Trump Administration's China Initiative policy aimed to limit cooperation between the U.S. and China and restrict the activities of scientists of Chinese descent in the U.S. Although the policy has been revoked, it may be reinstated if Trump returns to the presidency. This study explores the policy's effects on the academic performance, mobility, and collaboration of 190,292 scientists of Chinese descent in the U.S. before, during, and after the policy’s implementation. Then, by analyzing data from 1,152 paired scientists to examine the impact of their departure, we found that the policy led to a decrease in scientific output and reduced collaboration between the U.S. and China. It also caused a significant increase in the number of scientists of Chinese descent leaving the U.S., partially achieving its goal of restricting Chinese access to advanced American technology. However, the policy backfired by causing a loss of valuable scientific talent in the U.S. Most of these scientists returned to China and continued to produce research at levels comparable to their output before leaving the U.S. This study highlights the unintended consequences of restrictive policies on academic talent and international research collaboration.
